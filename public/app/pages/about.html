  <p>
  OpenTMI (Open Source Test Management Infrastructure or TooMuchInformation) is new kind of Test Management and Automation backend service. It is most suitable for test management for environments where software under test running on real hardware, like IoT-devices or Phone -platforms. In those scenarios most of existing Test Management tools are not very suitable because most of them doesn't understand requirements related hardware testing. Purpose is also to provide very customable backend, which can be easily integrate to currently used CI (Continuous integration) services, like Jenkins, but extend CI operations with much more hardware oriented test management approach.
